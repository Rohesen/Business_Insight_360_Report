- **Pre-Invoice Deductions**
- **Post-Invoice Deductions**
- **Net Invoice Sale**
- **Gross Margin**
- **Net Sales**
- **Net Profit**
- **COGS** (Cost of Goods Sold)
- **YTD** (Year to Date)
- **YTG** (Year to Go)
- **Direct Sales**
- **Retailers**
- **Distributors**
- **Consumers**

## üè¢ Company Background

AtliQ Hardware has experienced significant growth in recent years, expanding its business across the globe. The company specializes in selling computers and computer accessories through three primary channels:

1. **Retailers**
2. **Direct Sales**
3. **Distributors**

However, a recent expansion into the American market resulted in unforeseen losses. This decision was based on surveys, intuition, and some Excel analysis. Meanwhile, competitors with strong analytics teams have been making data-driven decisions, leaving AtliQ Hardware with no choice but to build its own analytics team. The goal is to leverage data-driven insights and make informed decisions to stay competitive in the industry.

## üìÇ Dataset Understanding

Before diving into the analysis, it's essential to grasp the available data. A clear understanding of the dataset lays the groundwork for meaningful insights.

### Dimension Tables üóÉÔ∏è

These tables contain static data, such as customer and product details.
- **gdb056**:
 - **dim_customer**:
  - 27 distinct markets (e.g., India, USA, Spain)
  - 75 distinct customers across all markets
  - 2 types of platforms:
    - Brick & Mortar: Physical/offline stores
    - E-commerce: Online stores (e.g., Amazon, Flipkart)
  - 3 sales channels:

  - Dates replaced by the start date of the month
  - Includes forecasted quantities needed by customers

- **fact_sales_monthly**:
  - Similar to the `fact_forecast_monthly` table
  - The last column shows sold quantities instead of forecasted values

### Additional Tables üóÇÔ∏è

- **gdb056**:
  - **freight_cost**:
    - Details travel and other costs for each market by fiscal year

    - Contains post-invoice deductions and other related details

## üõ†Ô∏è Importing Data into Power BI

For this project, the database is housed in MySQL. To begin, datasets were imported into Power BI by connecting to the MySQL database using the appropriate access credentials. This step was crucial for pulling in the necessary data to build insightful reports.

## üó∫Ô∏è Data Modeling

Data modeling is the foundation of any Power BI report. A well-structured data model ensures that all visuals perform efficiently and accurately. Poor data modeling can significantly degrade report performance, making it critical to follow best practices.

In this project, we adhered to the **Snowflake Data Modeling** method, which organizes the data in a way that supports complex queries and provides a scalable model for future reporting needs.
